# Git_Training
This repository is created for Git and GitHub training and experimentation. It will be used to practice core version control concepts such as repository setup, staging, committing, branching, merging, conflict resolution, and remote synchronization. The goal is to build practical fluency in using Git for real-world development workflows.
