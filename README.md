# Git_Training

A structured repository created for learning, practicing, and mastering Git and GitHub workflows. This space is dedicated to hands-on experimentation with key version control concepts such as commits, branching, merging, collaboration, and remote repository management.

---

## Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to develop strong working knowledge of Git and GitHub, enabling efficient version control, team collaboration, and best practices followed in real-world software development environments.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository
   `git clone <repo-url>`

2. Create or modify files for practice

3. Stage and commit your changes
   `git add .`
   `git commit -m "Your commit message"`

4. Push to GitHub
   `git push`

Feel free to experiment freely. This repo exists for practice.

If you want, I can also generate:

1. A Git learning roadmap
2. A list of practical exercises to perform in this repo
3. A detailed `.gitignore` setup

Just ask.
